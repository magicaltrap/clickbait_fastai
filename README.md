**Note:** In an [earlier repository](https://github.com/magicaltrap/clickbait_weka, "clickbait_weka), I used [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/index.html "Weka Homepage") to create a Machine Learning Classification model. This was a programming task of Sungkyunkwan University's ["Using Data Science to Detect Frauds and Fakes"](https://summer.skku.edu/_res/summer/etc/Data&Phy_A1.pdf "Class Syllabus") class. However, I was not too satisfied with the results, so I wanted to try a Deep Learning approach to get better results. Check the README.md and the Jupyter Notebooks for a detailed guide!
